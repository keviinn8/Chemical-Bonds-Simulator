# Chemical-Bonds-Simulator
## An application made to visualize how chemical bonds are formed and how elements react.

This program is an interactive chemical bonding simulator that shows the formation of ionic and covalent bonds.  By choosing elements from the periodic table to create covalent bonds, where atoms share electrons, or ions to create ionic bonds, where electrons are moved from one atom to another, it enables users to experiment with bonding.  Real-time visualizations of electron configurations, bond formation, and the resulting molecule or compound structures are displayed by the program.
